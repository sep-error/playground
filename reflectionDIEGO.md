REFLECTION QUESTIONS

1. What was the most challenging Git step?
The most challenging Git step was setting up the feature branch and pushing to it correctly. It was easy to forget to switch to the right branch before committing, and I had to double check that I was pushing to feature-Jean-vue instead of main. Also, making sure the folder structure was clean before staging everything took some attention to detail.

2. How did Vue components show reusability?
Vue components like StudentCard(mine was Jean.vue) demonstrated reusability by allowing me to create a single template for displaying student information and then use it multiple times with different props. Instead of rewriting HTML for each student, I just passed different data into the same component, which made the code cleaner and easier to maintain.

3. How would you extend this app?
I’d extend the app by adding a form to input new students, which updates the list dynamically. I’d also consider integrating Vue Router (from what I looked up from a browser)to create separate views for student details, and maybe use Vuex or Pinia (from what I looked up from a browser)for state management if the app grows larger.
