1. What was the most challenging Git step?
    - The hardest part for me was when I had to fix a problem that happened because two people changed the same file. The computer didn’t know which version to keep, so I had to choose and fix it myself. I was worried I might mess something up. I had to ask for help and learn how to fix it the right way. After that, I made sure to check for updates often and talk to my teammates so we wouldn’t run into the same problem again.
    
2. How did Vue components show reusability?
    - Vue helped us make small pieces of the app that we could use again and again. For example, we made one button that we used in many places—like on a form, on a pop-up, or on a menu. Instead of making a new button each time, we just used the same one and changed the words or colors. This saved us time and made the app easier to fix later.

3. How would you extend this app?
    - If I could make the app better, I would add more pages so people could go to different parts like a home page or a settings page. I’d also make it so people could log in and save their info. I’d make sure it works well on phones too, not just computers. These changes would make the app more useful and easier for people to enjoy.
