1. What was the most challenging Git step?
For me, the most challenging Git step was pushing my changes to GitHub.
I had to make sure I was on the right branch and used the correct commands.
It was confusing at first, but I learned how to fix mistakes and push my work properly.

2. How did Vue components show reusability?
For me, Vue components showed reusability because I made one card and used it many times.
I only had to write the code once, and I could change the name, language, and hobby for each student.
This made my code cleaner and saved time.

3. How would you extend this app?
For me, I would extend the app by adding a form where users can type their name, language, and hobby.
When they click submit, their card would appear on the page.
This would make the app more fun and interactive.
