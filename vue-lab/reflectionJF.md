1. What was the most challenging Git step?
The most challenging Git step was managing branches correctly especially remembering to switch to the right branch before making changes and pushing to the correct remote branch. It's easy to make mistakes if you're not careful.
2. How did Vue components show reusability?
Vue components show reusability by allowing you to define a piece of UI once and use it multiple times with different data. For example, the StudentCard component can be reused to display different students by simply passing different props like name, age, and hobby. This makes your code cleaner, more organized, and easier to maintain, since you don’t have to rewrite the same structure over and over.
3. How would you extend this app?
To extend the app, I’d add a form to input new students, use an array with v-for to display cards dynamically, and include features like sorting or filtering by hobby for better interactivity.
